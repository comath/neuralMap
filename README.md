# nnMapper

This is based on my paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02522
The objective of this project is to make a fast neural network mapper to use in algorithms to adaptively adjust the neural network topology to the data, harden the network against misclassifying data (see adverserial examples) and several other applications.
